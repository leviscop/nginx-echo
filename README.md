nginx-echo is a small docker image based on Alpine that returns the request URI
and hostname of the container. It is used for demonstration purposes or
debugging.

## Extend

If you wish to extend the information returned by nginx you can extend the text
for the return directive in `default.conf`.

## Build

The image on Docker Hub is automatically built by a merge to master, for local
builds you can use

```shell
docker build -t adfinissygroup/nginx-echo .
```
