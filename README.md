nginx-echo is a small docker image based on Alpine that returns the request URI
and hostname of the container. It is used for demonstration purposes or
debugging.

## Extend

If you wish to extend the information returned by nginx you can extend the text
for the return directive in `default.conf`.

## Run

The image is available on Github Packages.

```shell
docker run 
```
